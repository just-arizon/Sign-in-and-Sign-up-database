# Sign-in-and-Sign-up-database
A user's login and sign-up database repository is a common component in many web applications. It serves as a storage and management system for user authentication and registration information. The repository typically includes the necessary functionality to store, retrieve, update, and delete user data.
# Plan 
The user is introduced to a form where he inputs in his credidentials like his full-name, E-mail, username, password and another input field to confirm his password one more time. 
A when his or she does all of these, he is sent to another page that tells him the sign-up/login was successfull.
# PseudoCode
This are steps required to return the desired output. Here is an algorithm in pseudocode for this problem:

1. User Registration:

- Input: User's registration details (username, email, password, etc.)
- Validate the input data (e.g., check for required fields, validate email format)
- Check if the username or email already exists in the database
- If not, securely hash the password
- Generate a unique user ID
- Store the user details (including the hashed password) in the database

2. User Authentication:

- Input: User's login credentials (username/email and password)
- Retrieve the user record from the database based on the provided username/email
- Compare the stored hashed password with the provided password
- If the passwords match, authenticate the user and provide access to the application
- Otherwise, deny access and indicate invalid credentials
3. User Profile Management:
- Input: User ID and updated profile information
- Retrieve the user record from the database based on the provided user ID
- Update the relevant fields with the new information
- Store the updated user profile in the database
4. Password Reset:

- Input: User's email address for password reset request
- Generate a unique password reset token
- Store the token and its associated user in the database
- Send an email with a password reset link containing the token
5. Password Update:

- Input: User's password reset token and new password
- Validate the token and check if it exists in the database
- If the token is valid and not expired, securely hash the new password
- Update the user's password in the database with the new hashed password
- Invalidate the used token or mark it as expired in the database
6. Access Control:

- Input: User ID and requested resource/action
- Retrieve the user's record from the database based on the provided user ID
- Check the user's role or permissions to determine if they have access to the requested resource/action
- Grant or deny access accordingly

# Divide and Conquer (Implement)
Now we know what are sub problem is, let's head up to the implementing stage.
